## Code for America's Code of Conduct

### The Code for America community expects that Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums:

* Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
* Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
* Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
* Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
* Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy.
* Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
* Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
* Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
* Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
* Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
* Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
* Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
* Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.

_Code for America reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies to refrain from participating in Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums._

### Code for America's Anti-Harassment Policy

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://www.thefeministclub.nl/coc/), created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

This policy is based on several other policies, including the Feminist Group of Amsterdam, Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.

All Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.

In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Code for America will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, see this guide.

Code for America is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Code for America event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may expelled from Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, unwarranted exclusion, gaslighting, tone-policing, sealioning, and patronizing language or action.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums.

Harassment can also include persistent private communications (direct messages, text messages, etc). CDA members should publicly get permission from anyone with whom they would like to communicate privately before initiating such communication. It is up to the initiator of the conversation to gain this permission and, when in doubt, they should reaffirm they have this permission publicly. This permission can be rescinded at any time and, upon being told that private communications are no longer desired, the communication must cease immediately without further comment - including any messages intended to affirm that the request to cease communications is understood. It is expected that once permission to communicate privately is rescinded, no other words will be exchanged privately without regaining permission in a public forum. Failure to obtain permission or failure to cease communications when permission has been revoked constitutes harassment and is a violation of the CDA Code of Conduct. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff or forum administrator immediately. You can [__contact them here__](margeaux@civicdataalliance.org). Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.

You can also contact Code for America about harassment at safespace@codeforamerica.org and feel free to use the email template below. Code for America staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.

We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.

## In addition to the CfA CoC, CDA observes and enforces the following:

We recognise that everyone makes mistakes. We are forgiving, but not lenient. Repeated violations of these rules will results in any actions deemed appropriate by moderators, including warning the offender and removal from the community.

CDA is run by volunteers, people who make mistakes just like anyone else, and none of us are above reproach. Please report any violations of these rules by admins or moderator to a different admin or moderator.  

**WE BEHAVE ETHICALLY:** 
We expect all members (Core and Regular) of the brigade to conduct themselves in both a legal and ethical matter. This includes: following the process and rules for proposing a project to CDA, housing all CDA projects under the CDA Organization, in their own open repositories, on Github, promoting all CDA projects as community projects, appropriate use of CDA resources, including funds, giving proper attribution to partner organizations, members, or agencies on a project, and appropriate understanding of the elected positions within CDA, the process of elections, and the handing over of the positions during the election and instating process.*  

Examples of unethical behavior that will be subjected to a review of membership are: misuse or misappropriation of CDA funds and resources, claiming contributions to CDA projects without proof of work (private Github repositories will not be considered contributions, nor will be considered CDA projects as they violate the procedures and rules of a CDA project), promotion of a CDA project as personal project or work, promotion of a personal project as a CDA project, deliberate libel or slander against CDA or its members, refusing to step down or relinquish power from an elected position, attempts at deliberate subterfuge of elected positions or CDA itself, intentionally circumventing the values of transparency, openness, education, and engagement, and using CDA for personal gain.*  

**WE ARE INCLUSIVE:**
Do not engage in racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, sexist, ageist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior, including, but not limited to, any and all forms of shaming, erasure, and victim blaming. Do not make exclusionary jokes, not even ironically.  

**WE ARE INTERSECTIONAL:** 
We expect you to be willing to examine your privilege, language and other habits while you are here, and work on a growing understanding of intersectional feminism. We aim to be a place of learning, but we also expect you to do a lot of the grunt work of understanding basic concepts yourself; use the resources made available to you, search the group for any previous discussions, and search the Internet.

Because we hold to the values of inclusion and intersectionality, and recognize that not all people are given equal standing in many spaces, we commit to the practice of Progressive Stack. Progressive Stack is an intentional valuing and uplifting of marginalized or oppressed voices over those of privilege.The technique works by allowing people to speak on the basis of race, sex, and other group membership, with preference given to members of groups that are seen as the most marginalized. An explanation of the Progressive Stack can be found here. 

**THIS IS A SAFE SPACE:**
We aim to be a safe space for all our members. We consider impact before intent, and prioritize the safety of marginalised people over the comfort of the privileged. This means that, especially as a white person, you might be called out on problematic behavior. Do not confuse the discomfort this brings with being ‘unsafe’. We expect you to get explicit, enthusiastic consent for any manner of physical contact, including sexual attention, and simulated physical contact in online conversations. Respect boundaries, including, but not limited to, the withdrawal of consent at any time.

**RESPECT PRIVACY:**
Communication within this space is considered private, and each member is free to decide how much, or how little, they want to share. Do not share photos, screenshots, conversations or other information shared within the group with people outside of our community without the explicit consent of all involved. Do not share personal information of other participants, such as (but not limited to) email, phone number, address, etc. If you have received permission in the past, ask again; circumstances may have changed, and information may no longer be valid.

**RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE’S CHOICES:**
Do not pressure people into doing or trying things they are not comfortable with. Do not mock or denigrate other people’s choices in sexual orientation, gender expression, relationships, employment, style & dress, religion, food & drink, entertainment, or other lifestyle choices. Your path is not theirs, and the options available to them may well be more limited than yours. Respect the agency of others, always, but especially if you disagree.

**NOT ALL OPINIONS ARE EQUAL:**
We give no quarter to harmful opinions, and will not entertain anyone ‘debating’ their merits. This includes ‘reverse’ anything, whether it’s racism, sexism, or any other axis, as well as white supremacy, white feminism, exclusionary radical feminism of any kind, anti-semitism, any kind of apologism, and the use of ableist language. We respect a woman’s right to make her own choices about her own body. We celebrate the full spectrum of gender expression, sexual orientation, and attraction.

**ANGER IS VALID, AGGRESSION IS NOT:**
The expression of justified anger will not to be policed within this space. Tone policing and the expectation of politeness have long been used as tools for oppression, as reasons for dismissal of valid arguments, and we will not be complicit in propagating that behavior. There is no room for aggression, however; do not let your anger tempt you into violating the rules of this space.

**BE EMPATHETIC:**
We are all learning to be more compassionate, empathetic beings. When someone brings your attention to problematic behavior, thank them, and apologize. Ask permission to ask for clarification or suggestions for how to do better in the future. Do not debate or argue; even if you disagree.

**MODERATORS:**
To make sure that the spaces we provide for discussion, whether it’s the Facebook group or an event like a discussion night or film screening, remain safe, we have moderators who will monitor discussions, and intervene if they get out of hand. They have the ability to lock comments on a post, remove a post completely, or remove someone from the group if they are violation of this code of conduct, if that someone is not responsive to warnings. These moderators are volunteers, and, in most cases, will participate like everyone else. If they intervene, however, they assume the greater responsibility that comes with their greater powers, and their word will be law. You are expected to comply, even if you disagree. If you consider a particular intervention to be in violation of these rules, see #11 and #12.

**GROUNDS FOR IMMEDIATE REMOVAL:**
We do not condone threats, violence, hate speech, harrassment, unethical behaviour, or any other actions that are deemed by moderators to have caused significant harm or distress to members of this group. Such actions are grounds for immediate removal.

**REPORTING VIOLATIONS:**
If someone violates these rules, report them as soon as possible to one of the responsible moderators. For the Facebook group, this is best done by reporting the post via its ‘report to admin’ feature. It you are on Twitter, this is best accomplished by sending a DM to CDA's Twitter account. If you are attending an event, contact one of the organisers.

**HANDLING ADMIN AND MODERATOR MISCONDUCT:**


*These lists are not comprehensive, but examples of respective behaviors. Any behavior that is deemed questionable will be brought before the Core Membership.
